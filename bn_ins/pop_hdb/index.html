Ensure all airways are clear.</p>							<p><strong>LOCATION</strong> - The heater is designed to be wall mounted at         floor level. Typical applications are for room or office heating, although         under pew heating in churches is effective. Do NOT position header under         an electric outlet or device. Do NOT cover this heater or box it in or         in any way restrict the free circulation of air around it. Ensure no curtains         or similar materials get within 300mm of the top of the heater.</p>							<p><strong>WALL MOUNTING </strong> - The heater must be horizontally mounted.         Ensure any cables or conduits are securely attached (if used) and fix         the heater to the wall using the holes in the back of the unit. After         the screws have been tightened, loosen one half of a turn to allow for         expansion of the metal case.</p>							<p><strong>CONNECTIONS </strong>- Power entry is arranged to be at the left         hand end, terminal cover retained by 2 screws. Remove terminal cover.         Prepare the incoming power leads and attach the earth wire to the green         screw, having the symbol <img id="symbol" src="../symbol.gif" alt="earth symbol" name="symbol" height="15" width="15" />.         The live wire is normally brown or red should be connected to a wire to         the thermostat (if fitted) or to the thermal cut out. The neutral wire         usually black or blue should be connected to the wire direct on to the         element. THIS UNIT MUST BE EARTHED.</p>						<img id="opr2" src="opr2.gif" alt="wiring diagram" name="opr2" height="233" width="620" />							<p><strong>OPERATION</strong> - When energised the heater will provide its         maximum output. If an integral thermostat is fitted the temperature range         is 5 - 35&deg;C. The lower number on the dial indicating the lower temperatures,         the higher numbers, higher temperatures. For normal comfort conditions         numbers 3 - 4 are usually adequate. Should the unit register an abnormal         rise in temperature anywhere along the element the high limit control         will shut the heater down. It will automatically reset and repeat this         process until the cause is removed. If you are in any doubt, contact your         electrician for advice.</p>							<p>THIS UNIT IS NOT USER SERVICEABLE.</p>							<h5>GENERAL MAINTENANCE ON ELECTRIC HEATERS</h5>							<p>BN Thermic Electric Heaters are factory assembled and tested and are         non user serviceable. They are designed to operate for many years, problem         free.</p>							<p>All moving parts are factory lubricated and should require no service.</p>							<p>Maintenance is limited to the keeping of both inlet and exhaust areas         free from any accumulation of dust and other foreign materials. This is         especially important immediately before a heating season. Any dust build-up         can be loosened with a brush and a vacuum cleaner applied to the airways         to ensure complete removal of dust materials. An unusual odour may be         noted on the initial turn-on period as any dust particles may have been         disturbed and will be burnt off from the element.</p>							<p>If you are in any doubt contact your electrician for advice.</p>							<p><strong>Warranty</strong>.
