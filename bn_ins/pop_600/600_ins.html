It is important that the tubular heater be mounted horizontally to either a wall at low level, e.g. 300 mm from the floor, or actually on the floor using the brackets provided. Air should be allowed to circulate freely around the heater to avoid overheating. IT MUST NOT BE COVERED, THIS WILL AVOID THE RISK OF FIRE.</p>						<p><strong>INSTALLATION</strong>-The fixing brackets should be mounted according to the heater length at a distance so as to adequately support the heater usually about 300 mm from each end. Place the Tubular Heater on the brackets (ideally after the mains cable and cap have been fitted) and screw the bracket clamps into position. DO NOT ENERGISE THE HEATER UNTILL IT IS SECURED. This heater does get hot. We recommend the fitting of 600 WG Series wire guards if the heater could be easily touched or materials could come into contact with it. If these are not fitted the heater must not be at a height less than 1.8m from the ground in order to avoid the possibility of clothing, materials or bodily contact being made. The airflow around the heater must not be obstructed.</p>						<p class="tight"><strong>Cable connections to Tubular Heater</strong></p>						<p class="tight">A heat resistant 3 core (16/0.20mm) flexible cable to BS6500 should be used.</p>						<ol>							<li>Strip the outer sheath from the cable for approximately 25mm and bare the ends of the wires for approximately 10mm.</li>							<li>Remove screw from top of cap and remove cap.</li>							<li>Undo the cable gland nut and pass the flex through the nut and through the gland grommet, washer and gland.</li>							<li>Pass the wires and flex under the cable clamp and connect to the terminal as follows:- 5) Fit cap back on by locating rib in cap into slots provided on the terminal mount and screw back.<ol>							<li type="a">The Green-Yellow (earth) wire is to be screwed into the terminal marked <img id="symbol" src="../symbol.gif" alt="earth symbol" name="symbol" height="15" width="15" />.</li>							<li type="a">The Brown (live) wire is to be screwed into the terminal marked L.</li>									<li type="a">The Blue (neutral) wire is to be screwed into the terminal marked N. </li>									<li type="a" class="hide">TIGHTEN THE CABLE CLAMP SCREWS.</li>								</ol></li><li>Fit cap back on by locating rib in cap into slots provided on the terminal mount and screw back. </li>							<li>Ensure that there is not an excess of wire and/or flex inside and screw the gland nut back to the gland.</li>							<li>As an added safety feature the Series 600 Tubular Heaters are fitted with an automatic reset overheat device. Should the heater continue to operate on this device check that no objects are impeding airflow around the heater. If not turn the heater off and contact your electrician.</li>							<li>The input wire if connected to fixed wiring must have a fused double switch in the power circuit.</li>						</ol>						<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: When switching on the heater for the first time the element may emit a vapour for approximately two minutes. This is no cause for alarm, but merely the preservative being removed from the element.</p>						<p>THIS UNIT MUST BE EARTHED.</p>						<p><strong>WARNING - NON USER SERVICEABLE</strong> - Should difficulty be experienced with this heater consult a qualified electrician.</p>						<p>PLEASE RETAIN THESE INSTRUCTIONS FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.<br />							The manufacturers reserve the right to alter the specification on any product without prior notice.</p>					<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->					<h6><a id="pdf" title="product.pdf" name="pdf" href="../pop_ouh/ouh_ins.pdf" target="_blank">Download a pdf of our instruction sheet</a></h6>				</div>			</div>		</body>	<!-- InstanceEnd --></html>
