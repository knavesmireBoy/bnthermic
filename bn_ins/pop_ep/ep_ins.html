Remove and retain these instructions         for future use.</p>							<p><strong>LOCATION - </strong>Uses are for general space heating and therefore         must not be installed or used in areas containing flammable and/or explosive         materials or excessive dust or in the immediate surroundings of a bath,         shower or swimming pool. Do not cover the heater as this can cause overheating         and may damage the heater and could result in risk of fire.</p>							<p><strong>POSITIONING -</strong> This range of heaters is intended for low         level mounting, for optimum performance the heater should be mounted with         the base of the heater not more than 600mm or less than 150mm from the         floor. The heater must not be installed immediately below a fixed socket         outlet. For optimum performance the heater should be away from opening         doors and at the recommended height and air should be allowed to circulate         freely around the heater.</p>							<p><strong>WALL MOUNTING -</strong> Always ensure that the heater is mounted         level and with the air-vent at the top. The bracket should be removed         from the back of the heater and securely fixed to the wall. The heater         is then snapped into place.</p>							<p><strong>CONNECTIONS -</strong> Connections to the mains should be made by         means of a suitable plug or other switching device in accordance with         the current regulations and protected by an appropriate fuse or circuit         breaker. Connect the live wire (coloured brown) to the terminal marked         L and the neutral wire (coloured blue) to the terminal marked N. The third         wire (coloured black) is for use with a pilot wire control system. Assuming         such a system is not being employed, the wire should be insulated and         left unconnected. THE BLACK WIRE IS NOT AN EARTH WIRE. This is a Class         II heater and DOES NOT REQUIRE AN EARTH CONNECTION.</p>							<p><strong>CONTROLS - </strong>Two thumb-wheels are located at the top of the         unit. The thumb-wheel on the left should be set to 'A' to switch the heater         'off' and to 'M' to switch the heater 'on'.<br />								The thumb-wheel on the right is to adjust the setting of the electronic         thermostat. The highest setting is 9 and the lowest setting is 1. The         setting marked * is a frost-protection setting and is commonly used when         a room is to be left unoccupied for a period of time.<br />								The two pegs fixed in the thumb-wheel can be removed and positioned in         the holes in the back of the thumb-wheel to limit the adjustable range.       </p>							<h5>GENERAL MAINTENANCE ON ELECTRIC HEATERS</h5>							<p>Prior to commencing any period cleaning or servicing always ensure the         supply to the heater is completely isolated BN Thermic Electric heaters         are factory assembled and tested they are non user serviceable.</p>							<p>The heaters are intended to operate for many years, problem free.</p>							<p>Maintenance is limited to keeping both the inlet and outlet areas free         from any accumulation of dust or any other foreign materials. This is         especially important immediately before the heating season. Any dust build         up can be loosened using a brush and a vacuum cleaner applied to the airways         to ensure completed removal of any dust. </p>							<p>When the heater is first turned on after cleaning an unusual odour may         be noted, this is due to the dust particles which inevitably will be disturbed         and will be burnt off from the heating element.</p>							<p>If in any doubt always consult a qualified heating and ventilation engineer         / electrician for advice.</p>							<p><strong>WARRANTY. </strong>Your BN Thermic Heater is guaranteed for the         period of one year from the date of purchase. We will repair or replace         at our discretion any part found to be defective.<br />								BN Thermic cannot assume any consequential liability. This guarantee         in no way prejudices your rights under common law and is offered as an         addition to consumer liability rights.</p>					<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->					<h6><a id="pdf" title="product.pdf" name="pdf" href="../pop_ouh/ouh_ins.pdf" target="_blank">Download a pdf of our instruction sheet</a></h6>				</div>			</div>		</body>	<!-- InstanceEnd --></html>
