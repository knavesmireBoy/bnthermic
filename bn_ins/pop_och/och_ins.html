Any dust build up can         be loosened using a brush and a vacuum cleaner applied to the airways         to ensure completed removal of any dust When the heater is first turned         on after cleaning an unusual odour may be noted this is due to the dust         panicles which inevitably will be disturbed and will be burnt off from         the heating element</p>						<p>If in any doubt always consult a qualified electrician for advice.</p>						<p><strong>WARRANTY </strong>Your BN Thermic Heater is guaranteed for the         period of one year from the date of purchase.
