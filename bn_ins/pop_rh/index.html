When wall mounted the heater must be positioned horizontally. The minimum mounting height is 1.8m and the recommended height when used as an over door heater is 3m maximum. The area in front of the air intake and discharge must be kept completely free for a minimum of 1.5m.</p>						<p><strong>Installation</strong> – The following recess areas are required. RH-20: 327mm wide x 160mm high x 202mm deep RH-30: 572mm wide x 160mm high x 202mm deep The heater should be fixed in position using the pre-punched holes in the face of the unit. As both air inlet and discharge are through the face of the unit there is no need to make provision for air supply to the rear of the heater.</p>						<p><strong>Connections</strong> – Connections to the mains should be made by way of a suitable switch in accordance with current regulations and by a competent and qualified person. The unit should be protected by an appropriate fuse or circuit breaker. The live wire (usually brown) should be connected to the terminal marked L, the neutral wire (usually blue) should be connected to the terminal marked N and the earth wire (usually green/yellow) should be connected to the terminal with the symbol <img id="symbol" src="../symbol.gif" alt="earth symbol" name="symbol" height="15" width="15" />. THIS UNIT MUST BE EARTHED.</p>						<p><strong>Operation</strong> – On/off control may be achieved by using a suitably rated switch or thermostat. If required the heaters can be switched by the SCH-C30 or SCH-C20 wall mounted controller. These devices provide ‘fan only’ ‘high heat’ and ‘low heat’ selection.</p>						<p>The heaters are fitted with an over temperature protection device. Should this device operate, ensure no foreign matter is obstructing the airways. Should it operate repeatedly, isolate the heater and contact a qualified electrician.</p>					<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->					<h6><a id="pdf" title="product.pdf" name="pdf" href="../pop_ouh/ouh_ins.pdf" target="_blank">Download a pdf of our instruction sheet</a></h6>				</div>			</div>		</body>	<!-- InstanceEnd --></html>
