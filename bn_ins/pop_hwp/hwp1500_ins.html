Some applications may necessitate additional precautionary measures. </p><p>The heater conforms to IP55 and is thus suitable for outdoor installation. </p><p>Should the power cable be found to be damaged the heater must be returned to the supplier. </p><p><strong>Installation</strong>Installation should be carried out by a qualified electrician and in accordance with current electrical regulations. </p><p>The heater must be protected by a suitably rated isolator and fuse or type 3 (type C) mcb. </p><p>The heaters must be mounted horizontally using the mounting brackets provided. </p><p>A minimum gap of 600mm should be allowed between the top of the heater and the ceiling or roof. </p><p>Be sure that the heater is not facing the ceiling or a flammable surface. </p><p>The heater should be mounted a minimum of 2200mm above ground level. </p><p>Ensure that no flammable material could come into contact with the heater. </p><p><strong>Commissioning</strong>Perform insulation and earth continuity tests. </p><p>Switch on heater and ensure that the lamp is operating. </p><p>Ensure that the heater aims its warmth at the target area by adjusting the heater angle as necessary and tightening the retaining bolt when a satisfactory angle is achieved. </p><p>Check that the lamp remains in a horizontal plane.</p> <p>The user should be made aware of all aspects of operation and safety and advised to retain these instructions for reference. </p><p>In unoccupied premises it is recommended that the heating system is switched off and isolated from the electrical supply. </p><p><strong>Maintenance</strong>Halogen heaters contain no moving parts and therefore very little maintenance is required other than to ensure that there is no excessive build-up of dust or dirt on the reflector, emitter or fitting. To clean the heater, turn off and disconnect from the mains supply and, after allowing the heater to cool, wipe with a damp cloth.</p><p>The heater should be inspected at least once every year. More frequent inspection may be required depending on site conditions.</p><p>The halogen lamp is not field replaceable.</p><p><strong>Warranty</strong>Your BN Thermic product is guaranteed for one year from date of purchase.
