To maintain the protection rating all conections to the mains     must be done with a minimum of IP65 equipment. </p><p>    Ensure that there is no possibility of inflammable     material coming into contact with the heater, or is too near to the heater.     </p><p>    The essential element of the heater is the halogen     filled quartz linear lamp with a tungsten element. This operates at about     1600&deg;C and emits short wave infrared radiant heat. The lamp operates at     full output almost instantly and emits a radiant energy of 1.4microns. </p><p>    Quartz heaters are recommended by The Electricity     council and Building Services Research Association for General space     heating, Zone heating and localised spot heating </p><p>    This product conforms to EU Directive 2002/96/EC. </p><p>    This appliance bears the symbol of the crossed waste     bin. This indicates that, at the end of its useful life, it must not be     disposed of as domestic waste, but must be taken to a collection center for     waste electrical and electronic equipment. It is the user's responsibility     to dispose of this appliance through the appropriate channels at the end of     its useful life. Failure to do so may incur the penalties established by     laws governing waste disposal. </p><p>    BN Thermic Ltd </p><p>    Quartz &nbsp;Infrared </p><p>    HWP-3600-FM &nbsp;Outdoor Heater </p><p>    IP65 </p><p>    BN Thermic Ltd </p><p>    35 Stephenson Way </p><p>    Three Bridges, Crawley </p><p>    West Sussex </p><p>    RH10 1TN </p><p>    Tel: &nbsp;+44 (0)1293 547361 </p><p>    Fax: +44 (0)1293 531432 </p><p>    &nbsp;HYPERLINK &quot;http://www.bnthermic.co.uk&quot;     www.bnthermic.co.uk </p><p>    sales@bnthermic.co.uk </p><p>    INSTRUCTIONS SHOULD BE CAREFULLY READ BEFORE     INSTALLATION AND RETAINED BY THE USER.After unpacking ensure that the     appliance is complete and shows no signs of visible damage or tampering.  </p><p>    Keep packing materials, which are potential dangers,     away from children. </p><p>    Before connecting to the mains ensure that the voltage     is the same as indicated on the device. </p><p>    Do not touch the heater with wet hands; </p><p>    The heater should only be used with adult supervision. </p><p>    Avoid improper use of extension cords. </p><p>    Keep connections dry. </p><p>    If the appliance is not used for a long period,     disconnect it from the power supply. </p><p>    The heaters are fitted with safety guards. These are     intended only to stop large objects from hitting the emitters. On no     account should the heater be operated with the guard removed. </p><p>    The heating circle reaches a distance of about 4-6     meters around the appliance (Fig.10). </p><p>    The essential element of the heater is the halogen     filled quartz linear lamp with a tungsten element.  </p><p>    Positioning the Heater </p><p>    The fitting should be placed on a level and flat     surface. </p><p>    The unit should be mounted at a minimum of 1800 mm     above ground level. </p><p>    A minimum air gap of 400mm should always be allowed     between the top of the heater and a ceiling or roof (Fig.9). </p><p>    Be sure that the heater is not facing the ceiling or     inflammable substances. </p><p>    A safety distance of not less than 1000mm should always     be left in front of the heater. </p><p>    Ensure that there is no possibility of inflammable     material coming into contact with the heater, or lies underneath the     heater. </p><p>    Heaters should not be installed in areas where     hazardous vapours may be present. </p><p>    The appliance must not be located directly below a wall     socket. </p><p>    The heater must be installed so the switches     can&#8217;t be touched by someone in a shower or bath. </p><p>    If there is a risk of the heater being knocked, it must     be secured to the floor with suitable mounting screws through the base     (Fig.5). </p><p>    Installation </p><p>    Remove the 9 screws in the cover that has the rating     label attached to it (Fig.4). </p><p>    Depending upon how the fitting will be used the cable     can be fed in 1 of 4 ways. </p><p>    The cable is fed from the top down through the pole and     out of the bracket on the base as per Fig 2 </p><p>    The cable is fed through the bracket on the base (Fig     3) then through the pole and out the top of the fitting. </p><p>    The cable is fed from the top down through the pole and     out through the base. </p><p>    The cable is fed through the base, through the pole and     out the top of the fitting. </p><p>    Methods 3 &amp; 4 must only be used if permanently     mounting the fitting by screwing it to the ground! </p><p>    The fitting is wired so it can be connected to the     mains by single phase or three phase connection (3 lives + neutral + earth)     </p><p>    To wire the fitting single phase (220 &#8211; 240v),     connect the Live wire to the terminal marked L1, Connect the neutral wire     to the terminal marked N and the earth wire to the terminal marked &nbsp;     &nbsp; &nbsp; (Fig.7) </p><p>    To wire the fitting three phase (380 &#8211; 415v)     remove the link wires Marked A on fig.7 and connect the 3 live phases to L1     L2 and L3, connect the neutral wire to the terminal marked N and earth wire     to the terminal marked &nbsp; &nbsp; (Fig.8) </p><p>    The power cord must be clamped using the cable grip. </p><p>    The fitting must be earthed. </p><p>    Now replace the top cover using all 9 screws(fig.4)     NOTE:- All 9 screws must be used to ensure the IP rating. </p><p>    Assembling </p><p>    Join together the the two poles and secure with the 2     screws supplied (Fig.1). </p><p>    Insert the assembled poles into the base and tighten     &nbsp;the screw until the poles are secure (pic.2). </p><p>    Slide the heater onto the top pole and tighten the 3     screws until secure (Fig.3). </p><p>    Use </p><p>    Every lamp can be switched on with its own switch     (fig.6). When pressing the switch avoid touching any metal parts. All     heaters can be rotated to ensure that the heat is aiming at the correct     angle by twisting the handle on the end of each fitting (fig.6). All users     should be made aware of all aspects of operation and safety. In unoccupied     premises it is recommended that the heating system is switched off. </p><p>    Cleaning </p><p>    Before any cleaning or maintenance is performed ensure     that the heater is disconnected and isolated from the power supply. The     heaters contain no moving parts and therefore very little maintenance is     required other than to ensure that there is no excessive build-up of     dust/dirt on the reflectors or lamps as this can cause overheating and     premature lamp failure. To clean the appliance, wipe with a damp soft     cloth. </p><p>    Inspection </p><p>    If the fitting is used as a portable heat source the     mains cable must be regularly inspected to ensure it is not damaged in any     way. If damage is found the fitting must not be used and the mains cable     replaced by a qualified electrician. </p><p>    Lamp replacement </p><p>    The lamps used in the HWP fitting are robust and if     knocks and shock vibrations are avoided, will last for around 5000 hours.     For replacment contact your supplier. </p><p>    <br /> </p><p>    Please view these pictures while reading instructions </p>																																															<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->					<h6><a id="pdf" title="product.pdf" name="pdf" href="../pop_ouh/ouh_ins.pdf" target="_blank">Download a pdf of our instruction sheet</a></h6>				</div>			</div>		</body>	<!-- InstanceEnd --></html>
