Secure the heat tape with electrical tape (PVC) at intervals of not more than 200mm (8 inch).</li>							<li>For plastic pipes apply a layer of aluminium tape (AL50) between the pipe and the tape, including the thermostat to improve heat transfer.</li>							<li>When spiralled around the pipe the heat tape must be evenly spaced over the length of the pipe and the ENTIRE HEAT TAPE MUST BE USED: EXCESS HEAT TAPE CANNOT BE CROSSED BACK OVER ITSELF, BE LEFT COILED, OR BE LEFT HANGING OFF THE PIPE. SPIRALS MUST NOT BE CLOSER THAN 25mm (I inch). DO NOT CUT THE HEATING TAPE.</li>							<li>Make sure that electrical connections are made in accordance with the appropriate regulations by a qualified electrician. Usually a suitable fused spur connection is employed.												<ul>							<li>Ensure the heat tape is connected to the correct voltage supply following the colour code Green or Green/Yellow to the terminal marked with the letter E and/or the earth symbol <img id="symbol" src="../symbol.gif" alt="earth symbol" name="symbol" height="15" width="15" />.</li>							<li>Blue wire to terminal marked with the letter N or coloured Black. Brown wire to the terminal marked with letter L or coloured Red.</li>						</ul></li>													<li>The thermostat (the black cap in the moulded block) must be placed tightly against the pipe and secured with electrical tape. The thermostat should be placed on the coldest end of the pipe. The thermostat will sense the temperature of the pipe and turn the cable on and off to provide economical operation.</li>							<li>MAXIMUM 25mm (I inch) insulation should be used over the heat tape. IT MUST ALSO BE APPLIED OVER THE THERMOSTAT. Insulation must be protected with an additional waterproof overwrap if the pipe is exposed to the weather.</li>							<li>The thermostat turns the heat tape on when exposed to temperatures below 3ºC. It will shut the heat tape off when the pipe has been heated to a temperature several degrees above 3ºC.</li>							<li>For multiple tape installation an over-riding froststat is recommended to switch off the complete installation as the air temperature rises, thus conserving energy. FST-IN or FST-EX is recommended.</li>						</ol>						<p><strong>CAUTION</strong></p>						<ol>							<li>The heat tape must not touch, cross or overlap itself at any point. This will cause the heat tape to overheat.</li>							<li>The heat tape cannot be altered in length. Any attempt to physically alter the heat tape will void the warranty. Once cut, the heat tape cannot be repaired.</li>							<li>If the heat tape is stiff (due to the cold), first UNCOIL it then connect it to the rated supply until it is warm and pliable before applying it to the pipe. NEVER CONNECT THE HEAT TAPE WHEN IT IS COILED.</li>							<li>Do not install on pipes that are heated above 66 C (155 F), such as steam lines.</li>							<li>The heat tape MUST be spaced at least 13mm (½ inch) from any combustible materials.</li>							<li>NEVER use more than 20mm of fibreglass or polyurethane foam insulation. Over insulating can cause the heat tape itself to overheat, even with a properly installed thermostat.</li>							<li>The heat tape must protected from physical abuse, if it is applied in locations where it is likely to be damaged (e.g. chewing by animals, debris thrown from lawn mowers etc.).</li>						</ol>						<p><strong>SELECTION</strong></p>						<p>If insulation is fitted to current water bye law requirements, PGE Frost Protection Heat Tapes can be installed straight along the pipe to frost protect up to a 100mm (4 inch) pipe to -20 C. For lower temperatures or larger pipes consult factory.</p>						<p>The length of tape selected must therefore be equivalent to or greater than the length of pipe to be protected. Excess length is lost by evenly spiralling along the pipe.</p>						<p><strong>Supply voltage </strong>: 230v<br />							<strong>Heat Output </strong>: 17 watts per metre - constant - thermostatically controlled<br />							<strong>Maximum continuous exposure temperature</strong> : 65°C</p>						<p><strong>Warranty</strong>.
