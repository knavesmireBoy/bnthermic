Distance to         flammable building components: see figures for the various models.<br />								Ceiling rails and ceiling brackets are supplied with the radiant heater,         and can be used to mount the heater to the ceiling or fixture rail.<br />								The distance to the wall or ceiling may be extended with the use of chains         or wall brackets. These are supplied as extras.<br />								When mounting TVH, the connection box must always be the lowest point.         Do not mount the TVH low over permanent work places so that people are         exposed to high temperatures are head level. <br />								Do not mount TVH directly onto vinyl-covered ceiling panels, as the vinyl         will be damaged even at low temperatures. Do not place TVH very close         to large expanses of glass, as the glass may expand locally and crack.</p>							<p><strong>MOUNTING TVH 3000</strong></p>							<p> Mounting on enclosed ceiling rails and wall brackets.<br />								Four screws for mounting TVH are supplied with the heater and enclosed         in the connection box, along with four retention screws (with mounting         instructions).</p>							<img id="tvh2" src="tvh2.gif" alt="tvh2" name="tvh2" width="470" height="281"/>							<p><strong>MOUNTING TVH 4500 and TVH 6000</strong></p>							<p> Mounting on enclosed ceiling rails and wall brackets.<br />								Four screws for mounting TVH are supplied with the heater and enclosed         in the connection box, along with four retention screws (with mounting         instructions).</p>								<img id="tvh3" src="tvh3.gif" alt="tvh3" name="tvh3" width="470" height="300"/>							<p><strong>MOUNTING TO CEILING</strong></p>							<p> Mounting on enclosed ceiling rails and wall brackets.<br />								Four screws for mounting TVH are supplied with the heater and enclosed         in the connection box, along with four retention screws (with mounting         instructions).</p>								<img id="tvh4" src="tvh4.gif" alt="tvh4" name="tvh4" width="470" height="137"/>							<p>1. Screw enclosed ceiling rails onto ceiling.<br />								 The distance 134mm is the distance to the heater endplate.<br />								 The distance 207mm is the distance to the heater connection box.</p>							<p> 2. Fit silicone cable to heater.</p>							<p> 3. Attach enclosed wall brackets to heater.<br />								 (Attach with the M6 bolts supplied with the heater.)</p>							<p> 4. Slide the heater onto the ceiling rails and secure with the PAN head         screw A 3.5x13<br />								 and the PAN head screw C 3.5x19 supplied with the heater.</p>							<p> 5. Connect heater to the mains.</p>							<p><strong>ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION</strong></p>							<p>The heater must only be installed by an authorised electrician. The heater         is supplied with a 1-metre length of heat-resistant cable with a sealing         nipple that must be used because of the extremely high temperatures that         may arise.</p>							<p><strong>CONNECTION OPTIONS</strong></p>							<p><strong>TVH 3000 AND TVH 4500 </strong>are fitted with three identical elements         in the radiating surface.</p>							<p><strong> 400V/3ac</strong></p>						<img id="tvh8" src="tvh8.gif" alt="tvh8" name="tvh8" width="280" height="335"/>							<p><strong>TVH 6000</strong> is fitted with six identical elements in the radiating         surface. </p>							<p><strong> 400/3ac</strong></p>							<img id="tvh10" src="tvh10.gif" alt="tvh10" name="tvh10" width="280" height="221"/>							<p><strong>STARTING UP</strong><br />								Check that external and any internal cables are correctly connected up         in accordance with the diagrams. Elements are to be in a star configuration         for 3x400V, in a triangle configuration for 3x230V. The installation is         to be Megger-tested between phases and ground to disclose any short-circuits.         Resistance in the heater or circuit for several heaters is to be measured.         The resistance is to be the same for all phases.<br />								 Output control in 3-phase installations:<br />								<strong>P=2U<sup>2</sup>/R</strong> : P = output in watt, U = voltage, R = resistance         in W.<br />								 Switch on power and check that switches, thermostats, etc, function properly.<br />								<br />								<strong>Note! When switching the heater on for the first time, it is normal         for there to be some smoke and smell as binding agents in the insulation         burn off.<br />									When the heater is switched off or on, some crackling sounds are normal.         These are caused by the expansion or contraction of the elements.<br />									When the heater is switched on, the radiating surface will normally buckle         out about 1 cm; this will revert once the heater is switched off.</strong></p>							<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE.</strong><br />								The heater does not have built-in controls. Instructions for use must         be drawn up based on the type of external control equipment used.</p>							<p><strong>MAINTENANCE</strong><br />								The heater is maintenance-free, but it is particularly important that         the top be cleaned.<br />								 Thick layers of dust on the apparatus represent a fire hazard.<br />								 The firm should draw up routines for cleaning the heaters.</p>							<p><strong>WARRANTY</strong>. Your BN Thermic Heater is guaranteed for the period         of one year from the date of purchase. We will repair or replace at our         discretion any part found to be defective.<br />								BN Thermic cannot assume any consequential liability. This guarantee in         no way prejudices your rights under common law and is offered as an addition         to consumer liability rights.</p>												<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->					<h6><a id="pdf" title="product.pdf" name="pdf" href="../pop_ouh/ouh_ins.pdf" target="_blank">Download a pdf of our instruction sheet</a></h6>				</div>			</div>		</body>	<!-- InstanceEnd --></html>
