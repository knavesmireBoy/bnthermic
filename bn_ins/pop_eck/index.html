It should not be used with surfaces such as wood and vinyl or under carpeted areas.</li>								</ul>							</li>							<li>Check that you have the correct ECK kit.								<ul>									<li>Firstly you must calculate the area of floor to be heated.  This will be the total floor area minus the area occupied by fixtures such as cupboards, sinks, baths etc. Select a kit from the ECK schedule ensuring that the minimum ‘area to heat’ is no greater than your calculated area.</li>								</ul>							</li>							<li>Check the suitability of the controller								<ul>									<li>The G16C controller has two sensors (air &amp; floor). The F16C controller has a single sensor (floor). Both controllers have a switching capacity of 15A. If you intend to control a load greater than 15A, more than one controller will be required. The most common application for the F16C thermostat is when heating a bathroom floor. In this case it is usually mounted on the wall immediately outside the bathroom with the floor probe running through the wall and under the floor tiles. </li>								</ul>							</li>							<li class="split">First electrical check								<ul>									<li>Before starting installation and before unrolling the cable, the resistance of the cable should be measured and recorded on the Installation Record Form.  Ensure that the reading taken is consistent with the nominal output of the cable.</li>									<li>An insulation resistance reading should also be taken between either end of the cold lead conductor and the earth braid using a 500V dc Insulation Resistance Meter (Megger).  Readings in excess of 20 meg-ohms are acceptable.  Again the reading should be recorded on the Installation Record Form</li>									<li>NEVER APPLY POWER TO THE CABLE WHILE IT IS ROLLED UP</li>								</ul>							</li>							<li>Check and preparing the sub-floor								<ul>									<li>Ensure that the surface of the sub-floor is clean and free from any debris or sharp objects and suitable primer should then be applied.</li>								</ul>							</li>							<li>Cutting a groove for PVC pipes								<ul>									<li>Both the controller probe and cold lead should be run through a plastic pipe of an appropriate diameter (typically 10mm diameter plastic hose).  This is particularly important where the probe or cold lead pass from the floor to the wall.  To keep the floor level as low as possible, grooves can be cut into the sub-floor to accommodate these pipes.</li>								</ul>							</li>							<li>Positioning the controller probe								<ul>									<li>The controller probe should be mounted in a plastic pipe.  The end of the probe should be a minimum of 500mm from the wall and 30mm from a heating cable.  Remember to seal the end of the plastic tube with tape to prevent ingress by the adhesive.</li>								</ul>							</li>							<li>Laying the ECK cable								<ul>									<li>ECK cable should be laid in a neat grid formation and secured with the adhesive tape supplied.  The centres of each loop should not be less than 50mm.</li>									<li>At this stage it is good practice to take a photograph of the floor.  This will be a useful record should you need to carry out any work on the floor (for example drilling holes).</li>									<li>The tile adhesive can then be applied in the normal way taking care to ensure that the heating cable is completely covered and surrounded by the adhesive.  Before applying the tiles and before the adhesive dries, carry out the second electrical check (see below).</li>								</ul>								<ul>									<li>It is essential to avoid mechanical damage to the heating cable.  If it is impossible to avoid walking on the cable, use soft-shoes and/or crawling boards.</li>									<li>When you have finished laying the mat, you simply stop.  There is no requirement to return the end of the cable to the connection point.</li>									<li>The hot/cold junction must be in the floor itself and not in free air.</li>									<li>It is most important that the cables are not allowed to touch or cross. </li>								</ul>							</li>							<li class="split">Second electrical check								<ul>									<li>Once the cable has been laid onto the sub-floor and before the adhesive dries, the following checks should be performed.  All results should be recorded on the Installation Record Form</li>								</ul>								<ol>									<li type="a">Ensure that the resistance reading (ohms) is as recorded after the first electrical check</li>									<li type="a">Measure the insulation resistance between either end of the cold lead conductor and the earth braid using a 500V dc Insulation Resistance Meter (Megger), ensure that the insulation resistance is still in excess of 20 meg-ohms.</li>								</ol>							</li>							<li>Apply the tiles</li>							<li>Third electrical check								<ul>									<li>Once the tiles have been applied, the following checks should be performed.  All results should be recorded on the Installation Record Form.</li>								</ul>								<ol>									<li type="a">Ensure that the resistance reading (ohms) is as recorded after the first electrical check</li>									<li type="a">Measure the insulation resistance between either end of the cold lead conductor and the earth braid using a 500V dc Insulation Resistance Meter (Megger), ensure that the insulation resistance is still in excess of 20 meg-ohms</li>								</ol>							</li>							<li>Electrical connection								<ul>									<li>The electrical connection instructions supplied with the controller should be followed.
