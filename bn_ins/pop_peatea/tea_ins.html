Retain the instructions for future use.</p>							<p><strong>LOCATION</strong> - TEA portable heaters conform to IP44. They must         not be used in hazardous areas or in the immediate vicinity of baths,         showers or swimming pools. <br />								The heater must be placed on a steady and even surface. A minimum of 150mm         clearance is required above and to each side of the heater. No object         should be positioned within 2m of the outlet grille.</p>							<p><strong>CONNECTIONS</strong> - The TEA range is provided with the following         means of connection to the mains.<br />								 TEA321: 2m lead and 3-pin plug<br />								 TEA543: 2m lead and 16ACEE 5 round pin plug<br />								 TEA943: 16A CEE 5 round pin plug<br />								 TEA20: 2m lead with 63A CEE 4 round pin plug<br />								 TEA32: 2m lead (no plug)</p>							<p>Connection to the mains should be made in accordance with current regulations         and protected by an appropriate fuse or circuit breaker.</p>							<p><strong>OPERATION</strong> - All TEA heaters are fitted with an adjustable         thermostat and a heat output selector switch. TEA heaters are protected         by a manual-reset over-temperature protection device. Should this device         operate the heater must be isolated and any foreign matter that may be         obstructing the airways removed. Should the device operate repeatedly,         turn off the heater and consult a qualified electrician. <br />							</p>							<h5>GENERAL MAINTENANCE ON ELECTRlC HEATERS</h5>							<p>Prior to commencing any periodic cleaning or servicing always         ensure the supply to the heater is completely isolated.</p>							<p>BN Thermic Electric Heaters are factory assembled and tested and are         non user serviceable. </p>							<p>They are designed to operate for many years, problem free.</p>							<p>All moving parts are factory lubricated and therefore should require         no service.</p>							<p>Maintenance is limited to the keeping of both inlet and outlet areas         free from any accumulation of dust and other foreign materials. This is         especially important immediately before a heating season. Any dust build-up         can be loosened using a brush and a vacuum cleaner applied to the airways         to ensure complete removal of dust materials. When the heater is first         turned on after cleaning an unusual odour may be noted this is due to         the dust particles which inevitably will be disturbed and burnt off from         the heating element.</p>							<p>If in doubt always consult a qualified electrician for advice.</p>							<p><strong>WARRANTY.</strong> Your BN Thermic heater is guaranteed for a period of         one year from the date of purchase. We will repair or replace at our discretion         any part found to be defective.<br />								BN Thermic cannot assume any consequential liability. This guarantee in         no way prejudices your rights under common law and is offered as an addition         to consumer liability rights.<br />							</p>					<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->					<h6><a id="pdf" title="product.pdf" name="pdf" href="../pop_ouh/ouh_ins.pdf" target="_blank">Download a pdf of our instruction sheet</a></h6>				</div>			</div>		</body>	<!-- InstanceEnd --></html>
