Heaters of 2KW, 3KW and 4.5KW should have a safety           distance of at least 1.5mts.</li>							<li> You also should ensure no flammable material could come into contact           with the heater.</li>							<li> Heaters should not be installed in areas where hazardous vapours           may be present as defined in BS5345</li>							<li> It is recommended the heaters be operated with a guard in front of           the Ceramic element and should always be fitted to units mounted below           2.2mtrs.</li>							<li> The safety guards are only intended to prevent large objects from           directly hitting the Ceramic elements. Some applications will necessitate           additional precautionary measures.</li>							<li> The heater should only be installed in an indoor or weather protected           environment.</li>						</ul>						<p>The essential element of the heater is made from a ceramic material and         mainly radiates its energy in the long-wave infrared waveband.</p>						<p>Before installing this heater, please read all the enclosed instructions         carefully and follow any recommendations regarding installation and use.</p>						<p><strong>Electrical installation</strong></p>						<ul>							<li> Heaters are factory fitted with high temperature silicon rubber flexible           cable conforming to BS 6500 having a temperature rating of 180&deg;C           continuous.</li>							<li> Appliances must be earthed.</li>							<li> It is advised that Type 3 (Type C) MCBs are used. In multi-ceramic           single phase installations, in order to prevent the initial inrush current           causing nuisance tripping, MCBs over rated by 60-70% may be required.</li>						</ul>						<p>The CH fitting has been packed with a separate wall mounting bracket         ready for attachment to the heater. </p>						<p>Place heater face down and attach one &#8216;U&#8217; bracket to back.         Make sure cable gland is towards the bottom of the heater</p>						<p><img id="ch_mount" src="ch_mount.gif" alt="CH Mounting Diagram" name="ch_mount" width="470" height="127"></p>						<p><strong>Location</strong></p>						<ul>							<li> Heaters should be angled at 30&deg; to 45&deg; from the vertical           whether wall or ceiling mounted.</li>							<li> There must always be a minimum clearance of 450mm between top of           heater and ceiling.</li>						</ul>						<p><strong>Wall mounting</strong></p>						<ul>							<li> Decide whether vertical movement only (Diagram A) or vertical/horizontal           movement (Diagram B) is required for correct positioning of heaters           and assemble as shown.</li>							<li> Avoid mounting heaters on structures liable to vibrate.</li>							<li> Recommended mounting heights and safety distances should always be           observed.							</li>						</ul>						<p><strong>Recommended wall mounting heights</strong></p>						<table width="95%" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#000066">							<tr>								<th>&nbsp;</th>								<th colspan="3">Wall mounting Height<br />										(Metres)</th>								<th>Safety distance from Heater<br />										(Metres)</th>							</tr>							<tr>								<th>Model</th>								<th>Minimum</th>								<th>Recommended</th>								<th>Maximum</th>								<th>Minimum</th>							</tr>							<tr>								<td><strong>CH-1500</strong></td>								<td>2.2</td>								<td><em>2.5</em></td>								<td>3.5</td>								<td>1.5</td>							</tr>							<tr>								<td><strong>CH-3000</strong></td>								<td>2.8</td>								<td><em>3.5</em></td>								<td>4.5</td>								<td>1.5</td>							</tr>						</table>						<p><strong>Commissioning</strong></p>						<ul>							<li> Perform Insulation and Earth continuity Tests.</li>							<li> Switch on heater(s) and confirm that Ceramic element(s) operating.</li>							<li> Ensure each heater aims its warmth into the target area by adjusting           heater angle(s) as necessary then tighten bracket bolts when satisfactory           coverage is achieved.</li>							<li> The user/customer should be made aware of all aspects of operation           and safety and strongly advised to retain these instructions for reference.         </li>							<li>In unoccupied premises it is recommended that the heating system is           switched off and isolated from the electrical supply.</li>						</ul>						<p><strong>Maintenance</strong></p>						<p> Ceramic Heaters contain no moving parts and therefore very little maintenance         is required other than to ensure that there is no excessive build?up of         dust/dirt on the reflectors or Ceramic elements especially after a long         period of none use as this can cause overheating and premature ceramic         failure. Depending on siting conditions a heater should be regularly inspected,         but at least once per year.</p>						<p><strong>								 Before any maintenance work is carried out</strong></p>						<ul>							<li> Allow heater case/element to cool to avoid injury.</li>							<li> Always isolate appliance(s) from electrical power supply.</li>						</ul>						<p><strong>Spares</strong></p>						<ul>							<li> Spare Ceramic elements and reflectors are available contact your           supplier for details.							</li>						</ul>						<p><strong>WARRANTY</strong>.
