DO NOT COVER THE HEATER or restrict         the airflow in any way as this can cause overheating.</p>							<p><strong>POSITIONING</strong>- The heater is intended to be vertically or         horizontally wall mounted only. Either surface mounted, using the WHESB         or recessed. Do not obstruct the front of the heater for at least 1200mm.         Optimum mounting height is 1m from the floor. For recess mounting provide         an opening in the wall 182x358x80mm.</p>							<p><strong>INSTALLATION</strong>- For surface mounting fix the mounting box         to the wall securely. Remove the two screws securing the front cover and         locate the incoming wiring to suit the terminal connection point on the         heater. Where the wiring passes through the recess box use a knockout         suitably bushed. For surface mount using four screws fit the recess box         into the surface box. For recess mount, using four screws securely fit         the recess box to the wall.</p><img id="ovs" name="ovs" height=341 src="ovs.gif" width=496><img id="ovs3" name="ovs3" height=283 src="ovs3.gif" width=347>							<p><strong>CONNECTIONS</strong> - Connection to the mains should be made by way of a suitable switch, plug or other device in accordance with the current regulations and protected by an appropriate fuse or circuit breaker. Connect the heater using the live cable, usually red or brown to the terminal marked L, the neutral cable usually black or blue to the terminal marked N and the earth wire usually green or green/yellow to the terminal marked E and having the symbol <img id="symbol" src="../symbol.gif" alt="earth symbol" name="symbol" height="15" width="15" border="0" />. THIS UNIT MUST BE EARTHED.</p>							<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong>- The WHE is available with and without an integral         thermostat. If a thermostat (WHE-TB) is fitted it can be made tamperproof         by leaving the knob off and inserting the metal hole closer. Adjustment         is effected by using a screwdriver on the slotted thermostat shaft (after         prying out the closer). In either case set as follows:- Turn the knob         fully clockwise (maximum temperature). As the area warms up to the desired         temperature rotate the knob anti clockwise until a 'click' is heard. The         heater should now maintain that temperature setting. The heater is fitted         with an automatic reset overheat cut out.</p>							<h5>GENERAL MAINTENANCE ON ELECTRIC HEATERS</h5>							<p>BN Thermic Electric Heaters are factory assembled and tested and are         non user serviceable.</p>							<p>They are designed to operate for many years, problem free.</p>							<p>All moving parts are factory lubricated and should require no service.</p>							<p>Maintenance is limited to the keeping of both inlet and exhaust areas         free from any accumulation of dust and other foreign materials. This is         especially important immediately before a heating season. Any dust build-up         can be loosened with a brush and a vacuum cleaner applied to the airways         to ensure complete removal of dust materials. An unusual odour may be         noted on the initial turn-on period as any dust particles may have been         disturbed and will be burnt off from the element.</p>							<p>If you are in any doubt contact your electrician for advice.</p>							<p><strong>Warranty.</strong> Your BN Thermic product is guaranteed for one year         from date of purchase. We will repair or replace at our discretion any         part found to be defective. We cannot assume any consequential liability.         This guarantee in no way prejudices your rights under common law and is         offered as an addition to consumer liability rights.</p>					<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->					<h6><a id="pdf" title="product.pdf" name="pdf" href="../pop_ouh/ouh_ins.pdf" target="_blank">Download a pdf of our instruction sheet</a></h6>				</div>			</div>		</body>	<!-- InstanceEnd --></html>
