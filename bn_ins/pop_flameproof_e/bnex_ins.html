Isolate the electrical supply and remove the cover.<br />								 b. Internals should be clean and dry.<br />								 c. Ensure terminals are intact and secure.<br />								 d. Heating element insulation resistance to be at least 2 megohm.<br />								 e. Refit cover with new gasket if required.<br />								f. Earth continuity must be maintained between all earth points and main         structure.</p>							<p><strong>6.5.3 Annually</strong><br />								 a. Check all above.<br />								 b. Check for element failure or low insulation resistance.</p>							<p>6.6 Only BN Thermic Ltd or its approved agent to carry out heating element         replacement otherwise the Hazardous Area certification will be invalidated.<br />								6.7 If heaters are being left unused for a period greater than 3 months,         carry out 6 monthly maintenance before energizing.</p>							<p><strong>WIRING DIAGRAMS</strong></p>						<img id="wire1" src="wire1.gif" alt="Wiring Diagram" name="wire1" height="349" width="550" />							<img id="wire3" src="wire3.gif" alt="Wiring Diagram" name="wire3" width="250" height="250" />					<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->					<h6><a id="pdf" title="product.pdf" name="pdf" href="../pop_ouh/ouh_ins.pdf" target="_blank">Download a pdf of our instruction sheet</a></h6>				</div>			</div>		</body>	<!-- InstanceEnd --></html>
