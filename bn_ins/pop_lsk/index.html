Any dust build up can be loosened using a brush and a vacuum cleaner applied to the airways to ensure completed removal of any dust. When the heater is first turned on after cleaning an unusual odour may be noted this is due to the dust particles which inevitably will be disturbed and will be burnt off from the heating element.<br />								If in any doubt always consult a qualified electrician for advice.</p>						<p><b>WARRANTY.</b> Your BN Thermic Heater is guaranteed for the period         of one year from the date of purchase. We will repair or replace at our         discretion any part found to be defective.								BN Thermic cannot assume any consequential liability. This guarantee         in no way prejudices your rights under common law and is offered as an         addition to consumer liability rights.							</p>					<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->					<h6><a id="pdf" title="product.pdf" name="pdf" href="../pop_ouh/ouh_ins.pdf" target="_blank">Download a pdf of our instruction sheet</a></h6>				</div>			</div>		</body>	<!-- InstanceEnd --></html>
