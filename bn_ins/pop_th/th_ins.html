The heater is designed to be mounted in a trench with its grille at floor level. When used as a perimeter heater the air inlet is usually positioned on the wall/window side. It is most important to ensure that neither the air inlet nor outlet are covered or in any way obstructed.</p><p><strong>INSTALLATION</strong> - The heater should be placed in a trench so that its grille is at floor level. Level adjustments can be made by means of the levelling screws located in the base of the unit. The unit can be firmly fixed in position by screwing through the holes in the base.Generally, a Trench Heater is installed so that the air inlet is on the wall/window side.Units can be joined by removing end plates and bolting through the joiner flanges. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD THE CASING BE USED AS SHUTTERING WHERE CONCRETE IS POURED.THD dummy sections are length adjustable.  Measure the length of the gap to be filled.  Identify the slots around the casing closest to, but not greater than this length.  Using the slots as a guide, cut off and discard the excess length.  Make final adjustments to the overall length when fitting the end plates, which should be fixed in position using pop rivets.  Finally, cut the side trim and grille to the correct length.</p><p><strong>CONNECTIONS</strong> - Connection to the mains should be carried out by a competent and qualified person, by way of a suitably rated switch and in accordance with current regulations. The heater must be protected by an appropriate fuse or circuit breaker.Connect the heater as follows. Green/yellow wire to the terminal marked or with the letter E, Blue wire to the terminal marked with the letter N or coloured blue, Brown wire to the terminal marked with the letter L or coloured brown. THIS UNIT MUST BE EARTED.</p><p><strong>OPERATION</strong> - The TH heater can be supplied with a built-in, manually adjustable thermostat. Alternatively it can be controlled by a suitably mounted remote thermostat</p><p>The TH heater is fitted with a thermal-protection device that will operate should an overheat situation occur. In these circumstances isolate the heater, allow the heating element to cool and ensure that no foreign matter is obstructing the airway.</p><p>Should the thermal-protection device operate repeatedly, turn off the heater and contact a qualified electrician. </p><h5>GENERAL MAINTENANCE ON ELECTRIC HEATERS</h5><p>BN Thermic Electric Heaters are factory assembled and tested and are non-user serviceable.
