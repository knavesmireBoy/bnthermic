Either surface mounted, using the WHE-SB, or recessed. Do not install         closer than 250mm from the floor or above 2 metres from the floor. The         air intake and discharge grills should not be obstructed for up to 1200mm.         For recess mounting provide an opening in the wall 508 x 370x l08mm.</p>						<p><strong>INSTALLATION</strong> - For surface mounting fix the mounting box to the         wall securely. Remove the two screws securing the front cover. Locate         the incoming wiring at the top of the surface box or wall opening. Remove         a convenient knockout in the top of the recess box and fit an appropriate         hole bushing. Passing the wiring through the bushed hole fit the recess         box to the opening securely or screw to the surface box, using the six         screws provided.</p>						<img src="oac5.gif" width="270" height="120">						<p><strong>CONNECTIONS</strong> - Connection to the mains should be made by way of         a suitable switch, plug or other device in accordance with the current         regulations and protected by an appropriate fuse or circuit breaker. Connect         the heater using the live cable, usually red or brown to the terminal         marked L, the neutral cable usually black or blue to the terminal marked         N and the earth wire usually green or green/yellow to the terminal marked         E and having the symbol <img id="symbol" src="../symbol.gif" alt="earth symbol" name="symbol" height="15" width="15" />.         THIS UNIT MUST BE EARTHED.</p>						<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong> - The RFO is fitted with an integral thermostat. The         built-in thermostat can be set as follows:- Turn the knob fully clockwise         (maximum temperature). As the area warms up to the desired temperature         rotate the knob anti-clockwise until a 'click' is heard. The heater should         now maintain that temperature setting. The heater is fitted with a automatic         reset overheat cut out.</p>						<h5>GENERAL MAINTENANCE ON ELECTRIC HEATERS</h5>						<p>BN Thermic Electric Heaters are factory assembled and tested and are         non user serviceable.</p>						<p>They are designed to operate for many years, problem free.</p>						<p>All moving parts are factory lubricated and should require no service.</p>						<p>Maintenance is limited to the keeping of both inlet and exhaust areas         free from any accumulation of dust and other foreign materials. This is         especially important immediately before a heating season. Any dust build-up         can be loosened with a brush and a vacuum cleaner applied to the airways         to ensure complete removal of dust materials. An unusual odour may be         noted on the initial turn-on period as any dust particles may have been         disturbed and will be burnt off from the element.</p>						<p>If you are in any doubt contact your electrician for advice.</p>						<p><strong>Warranty.</strong> Your BN Thermic product is guaranteed for one year from         date of purchase. We will repair or replace at our discretion any part         found to be defective. We cannot assume any consequential liability. This         guarantee in no way prejudices your rights under common law and is offered         as an addition to consumer liability rights.<br>						</p>					<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->					<h6><a id="pdf" title="product.pdf" name="pdf" href="../pop_ouh/ouh_ins.pdf" target="_blank">Download a pdf of our instruction sheet</a></h6>				</div>			</div>		</body>	<!-- InstanceEnd --></html>
