						<h3>LH 
        Heating Elements Under Laminate Flooring Systems</h3>						<h4>INSTALLATION AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS</h4>						<p><strong>1) Introduction</strong></p>
						<p><strong>The LH Heating Element</strong></p>
						<p> LH consists of a specially formulated semi-conductive medium, coated 
        onto polyester film.<br />
							Power is fed to this resistive coating by way of copper conductors that         are fixed to the longitudinal edges of the heating areas. This structure         is insulated by a lamination of polyester based films that totally cover         the element and is wider than the conductive heating area, forming strong         clear edges that are designed to accept subsequent fixing to sub floor         surfaces.</p>						<p>Low temperature LH floor heating elements produce a gentle heat that evenly warms the entire room.</p>					<img id="lh1b" src="lh_diagram.gif" alt="lh1b" name="lh1b" height="143" width="250" border="0" livesrc="../../../web-data/SmartObjects/originals/lh_diagram.psd" />	<p class="lh_layer"><strong>LH         heating element is supplied fully prepared, cut to size, tails fitted         and insulated ready for installation. LH heating element should be installed         by a suitably qualified trades-person. It is not a &#8216;do it yourself&#8217;         product.</strong></p>												<p><strong>2) Installation Procedure</strong></p>
						<p>Before commencement of installation always check on the following:</p>
						<ol>							<li type="a">The building is weather tight, and that the glazing and doors have been fitted.</li>
							<li type="a">Any floor screeds, asphalt etc. have been laid and allowed to dry out.</li>							<li type="a">All electrical first fix wiring and other mechanical services through floors have been completed.</li>
							<li type="a">No cables must be allowed to come into contact with the LH heating elements.</li>
							<li type="a">All electrical connections must be made in accordance with IEE 16th edition regulations and<br />									carried out by a suitably qualified electrician.</li>
						</ol>
						<p><strong>3). Planning the Installation</strong></p>						<p>Draw a plan of the floor identifying areas occupied by fixed furniture 
        such as kitchen cabinets (heating elements should not be installed in 
        these areas).<br />
							Draw the heating elements on to the plan taking the following points into 
        consideration.</p>						<p> For best value, use a small number of long elements rather than a larger 
        number of short elements (remember element lengths can be reduced on site 
        if necessary)..<br />
							Whenever possible keep the element ends fitted with the live and neutral 
        cables along one wall. This should be the same wall on which the thermostat         is mounted.</p>						<p> A minimum gap of 50mm should be maintained between the wall and the 
        edge of the heating element. When a number of elements are being used 
        this distance may need to be increased slightly to allow space for the 
        cables to run to a junction box. Remember that small reductions in length 
        can easily be made on site.</p>						<p> For the most even heat distribution the elements should lay side by 
        side with no gap between them. Double-sided tape may help to hold the         elements in place. Small gaps between the elements will not significantly         affect the efficiency of the system. It is essential that neither the         copper conductors nor the black carbon stripes are allowed to &#8216;overlap&#8217;.</p>						<p>An element can be trimmed in length by cutting carefully width-ways between the black stripes. Trimming the element will expose the ends of the two copper conductors. These exposed ends should be insulated.</p>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Although all LH element is visually inspected at the factory 
        before dispatch the elements should be checked to ensure any rough handling 
        has not damaged the LH element. Look for creasing or folding of the product 
        that could have been caused by a roll of element being trodden on. Any         such damaged areas must be discarded and replaced.<br />
							Check that the connections at the end of the rolls have not been damaged. 
        The connections should be firm not loose.</p>						<p><strong>4). How to lay the film and connect it to the grid.</strong></p>						<p>Before laying the film, lay out a 6mm layer of Dep 6 insulation. The edges of the Depron sheets may be taped together to prevent them ‘Riding Up’. The layer of insulation also acts as sound deadening that is a requirement for laminate floors.</p>						<p>Locate the suitably fused, low level, junction box. Create channels in the Dep 6 insulation to accommodate the return of the cables to the junction box and a channel for the floor probe (floor probe supplied with thermostat). Run the element away from the junction point with the end that the cables are attached to being closest to the junction point.</p>						<p> The floor probe should be positioned in between element strips and should         be placed at least 1metre away from the wall. When you have a good idea         where the element will be positioned cut a channel in the insulation for         the probe to fit into. Never have the probe positioned under the heating         part of the element.</p>						<p> Never lay the strips of film in such a way that their heating surfaces         overlap or that nonheating cables pass under the element. You can fix         the element strips in place using tape.</p>						<div id="lh_img" class="imgbox">

							Individual cables should be fed back to local low-level fused spur termination         boxes (provided by the electrician) and planned not to exceed the 10 amp         element rating.</p>
						<p> Connection to the junction point should only be carried out by a qualified         electrician in accordance with IEE 16th Edition regulations.</p>						<div id="lh_img2" class="imgbox">							<p  class="overview"><strong>Overview of Installation</strong></p><p id="dp">LH element on top of Dep6 insulation and underneath DPM with laminate finally laid on top</p><p id="thermostat">Thermostat</p><p id="conduit">Conduit holding cables and lead for floor probe</p><p id="cabling">Cabling runs along grooves cut into the Depron Insulation back to the junction box</p><p id="tinned">Cable ends to be 'tinned' before making connection to the communing block in the junction box</p><p id="spur">Junction Spur</p><p id="floorprobe">Floor probe lying under clear edge of element</p>							<img id="lh3" src="lh31.jpg" alt="Installation Diagram" name="lh3" height="410" width="500" border="0" livesrc="lh31.psd" /></div>						<p class="split"><strong>5). Electrician Requirements</strong></p>						<p>All electrical connections must be made in accordance with IEE 16th Edition         regulations by a suitably qualified electrician. A fused spur or combined         spur / RCD is recommended.</p>						<p><strong>5a). First Resistance Check</strong></p>						<p> Once all the strips are laid and interconnected check the resistance 
        value of each circuit using an ohmmeter applying the formula:</p>						<table class="res">							<tr>
								<td><u>52900 (v&sup2;)</u></td>
								<td rowspan="2">= Resistance (ohms)</td>
							</tr>							<tr>
								<td>Watts</td>
							</tr>
						</table>
						<p>If all the circuits are functioning satisfactorily, lay clear polyethylene         film at least 0.2 mm thick upon the whole floor surface. The individual strips of polyethylene must overlap by at least 20 cm. This can be replaced with the laminate floor manufacturers preferred or recommended covering.</p>
						<p class="clear"><strong>5b). Thermostat</strong></p>						<p> The thermostat should be sited 1.5m from floor level, directly above 
        the element termination box(es) and away from the local heat sources and 
        large windows. A cable must be run from the junction box to the &#8216;common&#8217;         and &#8216;normally closed&#8217; terminals of the thermostat.</p>						<p> NOTE: Should the total connected load in any area exceed the rating 
        of the controller the electrician should provide a suitable switching 
        contactor (normally located adjacent to the distribution board) with a 
        switching feed to the controller. An option is to fit two controllers, 
        however this may create a temperature imbalance and is generally avoided.</p>						<p><strong>5c). Electrical considerations with reference to wiring from the         room thermostat to heating elements.</strong></p>
						<p> 1.5 mm&sup2; double insulated cable must be used for making up wiring 
        harnesses. To satisfy the requirements of an acceptable British Standard         sheathed single core cable to BS.6004 would be acceptable.</p>						<p><strong>6). Laying a floating floor.</strong></p>
						<p> The laminate floor must be laid according to the manufacturers recommendations. 
        When laying a floor you must take special care not to damage the element 
        and the supply cable. Walking on the LH element must be kept to a minimum. 
        When walking on the element cannot be avoided soft-soled shoes must be         worn.</p>						<p><strong>7). Second Resistance Check</strong></p>						<p> Once the laminate floor has been laid check the resistance of the total         circuit using an ohmmeter and record the result on the <a id="recordform" title="Record Form" name="recordform" href="http://www.bnthermic.co.uk/install/lh_installform.pdf" target="_blank" >installation         record form</a>.</p>						<p><strong>8).
