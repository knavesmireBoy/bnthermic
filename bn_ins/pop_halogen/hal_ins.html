Heaters of 3KW and 4.5KW should have a safety distance of at           least 1.5mts and the 6KW heater leave 2mts.</li>								<li>You also should ensure no flammable material could come into contact           with the heater.</li>								<li> Heaters should not be installed in areas where hazardous vapours           may be present as defined in BS5345</li>								<li> It is recommended the heaters be operated with a guard in front of           the lamp and should always be fitted to units mounted below 2.2mtrs.</li>								<li> The safety guards are only intended to prevent large objects from           directly hitting the lamps. Some applications will necessitate additional           precautionary measures.</li>								<li> The heater should only be installed in an indoor or weather protected           environment.</li>							</ul>							<p>The essential element of the heater is the halogen filled quartz linear         lamp with a tungsten element. This operates at about 2200&deg;C and is         housed in a quartz sleeve to filter out the white light and emit short         wave infrared radiant heat.</p>							<p>The lamp operates at full output almost instantly and emits a radiant         energy of 1.2microns.</p>							<p>Quartz heaters are recommended by The Electricity council and Building         Services Research Association for General space heating, Zone heating         and localised spot heating</p>							<p><strong>Before installing this heater, please read all the enclosed instructions         carefully and follow any recommendations regarding installation and use.</strong></p>							<p><strong>Electrical installation</strong><br />								 The H range comprises 1, 2 and 3 lamp Heater Models.</p>							<ul>								<li> One and two-lamp heater models are factory fitted with high temperature           silicon rubber flexible cable conforming to BS 6500 having a temperature           rating of 180&deg;C continuous.</li>								<li> Three-lamp heater models are factory wired according to the order           specification i.e. single phase or 3 phase and neutral. Use high temperature           silicon rubber flexible cable conforming to BS 6500 having a temperature           rating of 180&deg;C continuous.</li>								<li> Appliances must be earthed.</li>								<li> It is advised that Type 3 (Type C) MCBs are used. In multi-lamp single           phase installations, in order to prevent the initial inrush current           causing nuisance tripping, MCBs over rated by 60 - 70% may be required.</li>							</ul>							<p>The H fitting has been packed with a separate wall mounting bracket and         lamp(s) ready for attachment and fitting to the heater. Please leave the         lamp(s) in transit packing until ready to fit.</p>							<p><strong>Lamp Installation (If required)</strong><br />								 1) Undo 4 screws on each end cover, remove covers and safety guard.<br />								 2) Peel protective cover from reflector.<br />								3) Carefully remove lamp from its box, centre lamp to brackets with leads         pointing upwards.<br />								 4) Insert each end of lamp halfway under each spring clip.<br />								 5) Push each end of lamp with equal thumb pressure fully into clips.</p>							<p><img id="_1" src="1.gif" alt="lamp installation" name="_1" width="450" height="91" /></p>							<p>N.B. Any inadvertent finger marks on the tube glass sleeve can be removed         using methylated spirits on a soft cloth</p>							<p>6) Connect lamp leads to connector blocks. Tighten nuts/screws<br />								7) Re-assemble heater by fitting one-end cover, then guard and second         end-cover.<br />								 8) Ensure no wires are trapped under end-covers before tightening screws.<br />								9) Place heater face down and attach one &#8216;U&#8217; bracket to back.<br />								<img id="_2" src="2.gif" alt="mounting diagram" name="_2" width="470" height="127" /></p>							<p><strong>Location</strong></p>							<ul>								<li> Heaters should be angled at 30&deg; to 45&deg; from the vertical           whether wall or ceiling mounted.</li>								<li> There must always be a minimum clearance of 450mm between top of           heater and ceiling.</li>							</ul>							<p><strong>Wall mounting</strong></p>							<ul>								<li> Decide whether vertical movement only (Diagram A) or vertical/horizontal           movement (Diagram B) is required for correct positioning of heaters           and assemble as shown.</li>								<li> Avoid mounting heaters on structures liable to vibrate.</li>								<li> Recommended mounting heights and safety distances should always be           observed.<br />								</li>							</ul>							<table>								<tr>									<td>&nbsp;</td>									<th colspan="3">Wall mounting Height<br />									(Metres)</th>									<th>Safety distance from Heater<br />									(Metres)</th>								</tr>								<tr>									<th>Output</th>									<th>Minimum</th>									<th>Recommended</th>									<th>Maximum</th>									<th>Minimum</th>								</tr>								<tr>									<td><strong>1 or 1.5kW</strong></td>									<td>2.2</td>									<td>2.5</td>									<td>3.0</td>									<td>1.0</td>								</tr>								<tr>									<td><strong>2kW</strong></td>									<td>2.2</td>									<td>2.5</td>									<td>3.2</td>									<td>1.5</td>								</tr>								<tr>									<td><strong>3kW</strong></td>									<td>2.2</td>									<td>2.5</td>									<td>3.5</td>									<td>1.5</td>								</tr>								<tr>									<td><strong>4kW</strong></td>									<td>2.5</td>									<td>3.5</td>									<td>4.0</td>									<td>1.5</td>								</tr>								<tr>									<td><strong>4.5kW</strong></td>									<td>3.0</td>									<td>3.5</td>									<td>4.5</td>									<td>1.5</td>								</tr>								<tr>									<td><strong>6.0kW</strong></td>									<td>3.5</td>									<td>4.0</td>									<td>5.5</td>									<td>2.0</td>								</tr>							</table>														<p><strong>Commissioning</strong></p>							<ul>								<li>Perform Insulation and Earth continuity Tests.</li>								<li> Switch on heater(s) and confirm that lamp(s) operating.</li>								<li> Ensure each heater aims its warmth into the target area by adjusting           heater angle(s) as necessary then tighten bracket bolts when satisfactory           coverage is achieved.</li>								<li> Check that lamp(s) remain in a horizontal plane for all angles of           heater(s).</li>								<li> Lamps must only be operated within 5&deg; of the horizontal plane.</li>								<li> The user/customer should be made aware of all aspects of operation           and safety and strongly advised to retain these instructions for reference.</li>								<li> In unoccupied premises it is recommended that the heating system           is switched off and isolated from the electrical supply.</li>							</ul>							<p><strong>Maintenance</strong><br />								Halogen heaters contain no moving parts and therefore very little maintenance         is required other than to ensure that there is no excessive build?up of         dust/dirt on the reflectors or lamps as this can cause overheating and         premature lamp failure. Depending on siting conditions a heater should         be regularly inspected, but at least once per year.</p>							<p><strong>Before any maintenance work is carried out</strong></p>							<ul>								<li> Allow heater case/lamp to cool to avoid injury.</li>								<li> Always isolate appliance(s) from electrical power supply.</li>								<li> Re-read instructions prior to lamp replacement. </li>							</ul>							<p><strong>WARRANTY</strong>.
