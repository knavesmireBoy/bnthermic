They are intended for use normal dry atmospheres and should not be exposed to excessively damp conditions.</p>						<p><strong>Packaging</strong> – Carefully unpack the heater and discard the packaging.</p>						<p><strong>Location</strong> – When used above a doorway, the heater can be wall or ceiling mounted at a height between 1.8m and 3m above floor level and a minimum of 300mm from adjacent walls. It must be mounted horizontally. When used as a space heater, it should be wall mounted at a height between 1.8m and 3m above floor level and a minimum of 300mm from the ceiling and adjacent walls. Ensure that the airflow through the heater is not obstructed in any way and that no object is closer than 1.5m from the heater outlet. Do not position the heater beneath a socket outlet.</p>						<p><strong>Mounting</strong> – The mounting kit supplied with each heater consists of the following items.</p>						<p>1 x 574mm long Fixing Plate</p>						<p>2 x L shaped End Brackets</p>						<p>2 x Plastic Domes</p>						<p>4 x M2.9 screws</p>						<p>6 x M4 bolts</p>						<p><strong>A. Wall mounting above a doorway</strong> Inspect the Fixing Plate. You will see that it has a side with countersunk holes. This is the back of the Fixing Plate and will eventually be mounted against the wall. Offer the long section of the two End Brackets up to the front of the Fixing Plate so that the threaded holes align with the countersunk holes. Use the six M4 bolts to fix the End Brackets to the Fixing Plate ensuring that the 90° bends in the brackets are at the extreme ends of the Fixing Plate. Use the slots in the Fixing Plate to fix this assembly securely to the wall. Offer the heater up to the brackets, ensuring that the air outlet is pointing vertically downwards. The plastic spigot in either end of the heater should be firmly located in the 25mm diameter hole in the End Bracket. Lock the heater in place by using the four screws provided to fit the Plastic Domes to the outside of each End Bracket.</p>						<p><strong>B. Ceiling mounting above a doorway</strong></p>						<p>The mounting method is as described above (A) with the following changes. 1. The short section of the End Bracket should be fixed to the Fixing Plate using four M4 bolts (the other two bolts can be discarded). 2. The Fixing Plate should be fixed to the ceiling rather than the wall.</p>						<p><strong>C. Wall mounting for space heating</strong></p>						<p>The mounting method is as described above (A) with the following changes. 1. The short section of the End Bracket should be fixed to the Fixing Plate using four M4 bolts (the other two bolts can be discarded). 2. Before locking the heater in place with the Plastic Domes, the angle of the heater outlet can be adjusted between 90° (horizontal) and 180° (vertically downwards).</p>						<p><strong>Connection</strong> – Always check that the supply voltage is the same as shown on the rating label. Ensure that a suitably rated power outlet is within reach of the pre-wired mains cable and that this cable does not pass over the inlet or outlet of the heater. If the supply cord is damaged the heater must be returned to the manufacturer. Connection to the mains power should be by way of a suitably rated all pole disconnection device. This device must have a minimum of 3mm contact gap separation. 730 &amp; 730T should be protected by a 20 Amp circuit breaker. 745 should be protected by a 32 Amp circuit breaker. The Live cable, usually brown, should be connected to the terminal marked L. The Neutral cable, usually blue, should be connected to the terminal marked N. The Earth cable, usually green and yellow, should be connected to the terminal marked E and having the earth symbol.</p>						<p><strong>Operation</strong> – The 730 is fitted with a three-position switch. The central position is ‘off’. The position marked with a blue flash energises the fan but not the heating element. The position marked with a red flash energises the fan and the heating element. The 703T has two-position switch for on/off control and a rotary knob for adjusting the set-point of the built-in electronic thermostat. When the switch is in the ‘on’ position the fan will run continuously and the electronic thermostat will control the heater output to maintain the required room temperature. The heater is fitted with a thermal-protection device that will turn off the heating element should an overheat situation occur (the fan will continue to operate). In these circumstances, isolate the heater, allow the unit to cool and ensure that no foreign matter is obstructing the airway through the heater before re-energising. Should the thermal-protection device operate repeatedly, turn off the heater and contact a qualified electrician. The 745 is fitted with a three-position switch. The central position is 'Off'. The position marked 'I' provides 2.25kW output, whilst the position marked 'II' provides 4.5kW output.</p>						<p><strong>Maintenance </strong>– This heater is factory assembled and tested with all moving parts being factory lubricated. It is intended for many years of satisfactory operation without servicing by the user. Maintenance is limited to keeping the heater clean and preventing an accumulation of dust or other foreign material. Periodically and at least once every year the heater should be wiped over with a soft dry cloth to remove dust. Any bust build-up in the air inlet and outlet should be loosened with a brush and a vacuum cleaner applied to the airway to ensure all dust is removed. When the heater is first turned on after cleaning an unusual odour may be noted. This is a result of dust particles being burnt off the heating element and should not be a cause of concern.</p>						<p>If in doubt always contact a qualified electrician.</p>						<p><strong>Warranty</strong> – Your BN Thermic product is guaranteed for one year from date of purchase. We will repair or replace, at our discretion, any part found to be defective. We cannot accept any consequential liability. This guarantee in no way prejudices your rights under common law and is offered as an addition to consumer liability rights.</p>					<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->					<h6><a id="pdf" title="product.pdf" name="pdf" href="../pop_ouh/ouh_ins.pdf" target="_blank">Download a pdf of our instruction sheet</a></h6>				</div>			</div>		</body>	<!-- InstanceEnd --></html>
