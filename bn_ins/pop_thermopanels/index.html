When the heater         is first turned on after cleaning an unusual odour may be noted this is         due to the dust particles which inevitably will be disturbed and will         be burnt off during the heating process.<br />								 If in any doubt always consult a qualified electrician for advice.</p>							<p><strong>WARRANTY</strong> - Your BN Thermic Heater is guaranteed for the         period of one year from the date of purchase.
