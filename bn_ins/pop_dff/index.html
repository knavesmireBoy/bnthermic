Retain the instructions for future use.</p>						<p><strong>LOCATION -</strong>The unit should be installed at the highest         available position but not higher than 12m (DFF-23) or 18m (DFF-47). For         best results, ensure that the discharge air is not impeded by racking         or other equipment.</p>						<p><strong>INSTALLATION -</strong>DFF Downflow Fans are designed to be suspended         from chains. It is essential that both the chains and the method of securing         the chains to the building's structure are suitable for the weight of         the unit.<br />							The unit is fitted with louvres that can be adjusted for the comfort of         the building's occupants.</p>						<p><strong>CONNECTIONS - </strong>Connections to the mains should be made by         means of a suitably rated switching device, in accordance with the current         regulations and protected by an appropriate fuse or circuit breaker. Remove         the terminal enclosure cover and connect the live wire (coloured brown)         to the terminal marked L, the neutral wire (coloured blue) to the terminal         marked N and the earth wire (coloured green and yellow) to the terminal         marked E. THIS UNIT MUST BE EARTHED. The thermostat should be set to a         temperature approximately 2&ordm;C higher than the building design temperature.         As a guide, a setting of 6 on the thermostat scale is aproximately equal         to 25&ordm;C. Once all connections have been made and the thermostat has         been set, the terminal enclosure cover should be replaced and secured         in place. </p>						<p><strong>MAINTENANCE -</strong>Prior to commencing any maintenance ensure         the unit is completely isolated. The unit should be inspected at least         once a year to ensure both inlet and outlet areas are free from the accumulation         of dust and other foreign bodies and that the mounting system is secure         and has not been affected by rust or structural decay.<br />							 All moving parts are factory lubricated and should require no service.</p>						<p>If in doubt always consult a qualified electrician.</p>						<p><strong>WARRANTY -</strong>Your BN Thermic product is guaranteed for a         period of one year from date of purchase. We will repair or replace at         our discretion any part found to be defective.<br />							BN Thermic cannot assume any consequential liability.
