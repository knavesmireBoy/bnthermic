For optimum         results do not fit in ceilings higher than 3m. As air is only introduced         through the front of the unit the heater may be sighted anywhere. The         air intake and discharge areas must be kept completely clear for a minimum         of 1.5m from the front of the heater. In an area using multiple units.         heaters should be spread to provide an even heating distribution.</p>						<p><strong>INSTALLATION</strong> - If the diffuser is not fitted the unit may         be installed by placing within the 'tee' bar. For reduced sized tiles,         i.e. adjacent to walls, windows or doorways the front cover may be reduced         in size to 400mm by carefully sawing the front cover. If a diffuser is         fitted the four brackets provided should be attached to the side of the         heater to enable the heater to be supported by the 'tee' bar and immediately         above the diffuser. ONLY the SCH-ECD is recommended. DO NOT use plastic         type diffusers as these may be damaged by the heat. Note: Attention should         be paid to the adequacy of the ceiling support to ensure the additional         weight can be safely accommodated.</p>						<p><strong>CONNECTIONS</strong>: The heater is supplied with a convenient length         of suitable flex. Connections to the mains should be wired by a competent         &amp; qualified person, by way of a suitable 20 amp switch in accordance         with the current regulations and protected by an appropriate fuse or circuit         breaker. Connect the heater as follows. Green / Yellow wire to <span>terminal         marked </span> or with the         letter E, Blue wire to the terminal marked with the letter N or coloured         blue. Brown wire to the terminal marked with the letter L or coloured         brown. THIS UNIT MUST BE EARTHED.</p>						<p>The 3kW heater may be converted, on site to 1.0 or 2.0kW output similarly         it may be rewired to accommodate fan only operation. To modify this the         front cover must be removed and the wiring changes as shown on drawing         W-SCH-30E for the electronic model and W-SCH-30 for the standard model,         should be followed. The 4.5kW heater may be converted, on site to 2.25kW         output, similarly it may be rewired to accommodate fan only operation.         To modify this the front cover must be removed and the wiring changes         on the drawing W-SCH-45 should be followed. IMPORTANT: Before attempting         to carry out any work or modifications ensure the supply to the heater         is completely isolated from the electrical supply. This work should only         be carried out by a qualified skilled person competent to do this work.</p>						<p><img src="conn_30.gif" width="620" height="690">                        <img src="conn_45.gif" width="620" height="695">                         <img src="conn_30E.gif" width="620" height="708"></p>						<p><strong>OPERATION</strong>: </p>						<p><strong>SCHG-30 </strong>        The heater may be manually switched off by a suitably rated device minimum         20 amps, or wired in conjunction with the SCH-C-30 control panel. </p>						<p><strong>SCHG-30-E </strong>        As above and in addition the heater incorporates an electronic thermostat         with thermostat sensor. The adjustment is achieved by rotating the control         knob on the back of the unit clockwise for a higher room temperature,         and anti clockwise for lower room temperature. When the desired room temperature         is achieved no further adjustments are necessary. The thermostat will         cycle as required and the fan will operate continuously to evenly distribute         the heated air.</p>						<p><strong>SCHG-45</strong> The heater may be switched off by a suitable rated device         minimum 20 amps, or wired in conjunction with the SCH-C-45 control panel.</p>						<p>This heater is fitted with a semi-automatic safety device to prevent         overheating, but the fan continues to operate. Should this occur, check         and remove any foreign materials around the airways. If the heater fails         to operate or the safety cut out operates again, turn off the heater and         contact a qualified electrician.</p>						<p>Do not cover this heater as this can cause overheating and may damage         the heater.</p>						<h5>GENERAL MAINTENANCE ON ELECTRIC HEATERS</h5>						<p>Prior to commencing any periodic cleaning or servicing always ensure         the supply to the heater is completely isolated BN Thermic Electric heaters         are factory assembled and tested they are non user serviceable.</p>						<p>The heaters are intended to operate for many years, problem free.</p>						<p>All moving parts are factory lubricated and therefore should require         no service.</p>						<p>Maintenance is limited to keeping both the inlet and outlet areas free         from any accumulation of dust or any other foreign materials. This is         especially important immediately before the heating season. Any dust build         up can be loosened using a brush and a vacuum cleaner applied to the airways         to ensure completed removal of any dust . When the heater is first turned         on after cleaning an unusual odour may be noted this is due to the dust         particles which inevitably will be disturbed and will be burnt off from         the heating element.</p>						<p>If in any doubt always consult a qualified electrician for advice.</p>						<p><strong>WARRANTY</strong>.
