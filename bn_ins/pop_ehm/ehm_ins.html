Retain the instructions for reference.</p>						<ol class="floor">							<li>Personnel.								<ul>									<li>EHM should be installed by a suitably qualified, professional builder and/or electrician.  EHM is not a ‘do it yourself’ product.It is most important that the installer completes the Installation Record Form that forms part of this booklet.</li>								</ul>							</li>							<li>Check the suitability of sub-floor.								<ul>									<li>EHM can be installed onto concrete or wooden sub-floors.  We do not recommend installation onto asphalt sub-floors or any insulation material other than rigid boards.</li>								</ul>							</li>							<li>Check the suitability of the tile adhesive.								<ul>									<li>EHM is designed to sit in a layer of adhesive below ceramic or stone tiles.  EHM has been used with a wide variety of tile adhesives.  We suggest that the suitability of any given adhesive be confirmed by the adhesive supplier.</li>									<li>If preferred EHM can be buried in a layer of screed.  If you intend to use a compound other than a cement screed, the suitability of the compound should be confirmed by the compound supplier.</li>								</ul>							</li>							<li>Check the suitability of the floor surface.								<ul>									<li>EHM is suitable for use with ceramic and stone floors, including slate and marble. It should not be used with surfaces such as wood and vinyl or under carpeted areas.</li>								</ul>							</li>							<li>Check that you have the correct EHM mat								<ul>									<li>Firstly you must calculate the area of floor to be heated.  This will be the total floor area minus the area occupied by fixtures such as cupboards, sinks, baths etc. Refer to the schedule of mats to find the mat with a square area slightly lower than you calculated figure.  This is likely to be the mat for you.</li>									<li>To double-check your selection, draw a sketch of the free area.  Leaving a space of 30mm between mat runs and 80mm between the mats and the wall, draw the mat runs onto your sketch.  Remember you can cut the mat at any point along its length but you cannot alter its width.</li>									<li>If you are unsure whether there is quite enough space to install a particular EHM mat, you should consider using a slightly smaller mat. REMEMBER ALTHOUGH YOU CAN CUT THE MAT AT ANY POINT YOU MUST NOT CUT THE HEATING CABLE.</li>								</ul>							</li>							<li class="split">Check the suitability of the controller								<ul>																																	<li>Ensure that the total installed load does not exceed the switching capacity of the selected controller.  Larger loads can be switched using a suitably rated contactor.									</li>								</ul>							</li>							<li>First electrical check								<ul>									<li>Before starting installation and before unrolling the mat, the resistance of the cable should be measured and recorded on the Installation Record Form.  Ensure that the reading taken is consistent with the nominal output of the cable.</li>									<li>An insulation resistance reading should also be taken between either end of the cold lead conductor and the earth braid using a 500V dc Insulation Resistance Meter (Megger).  Readings in excess of 20 meg-ohms are acceptable.  Again the reading should be recorded on the Installation Record Form</li>									<li>NEVER APPLY POWER TO THE MAT WHILE IT IS ROLLED UP</li>								</ul>							</li>							<li>Check and preparing the sub-floor								<ul>									<li>Ensure that the surface of the sub-floor is clean and free from any debris or sharp objects and suitable primer should then be applied.</li>								</ul>							</li>							<li>Cutting a groove for PVC pipes								<ul>									<li>Both the controller probe and cold lead should be run through a plastic pipe of an appropriate diameter (typically 10mm diameter plastic hose).  This is particularly important where the probe or cold lead pass from the floor to the wall.  To keep the floor level as low as possible, grooves can be cut into the sub-floor to accommodate these pipes.</li>								</ul>							</li>							<li>Positioning the controller probe								<ul>									<li>The controller probe should be mounted in a plastic pipe.  The end of the probe should be a minimum of 500mm from the wall and 30mm from a heating cable.  Remember to seal the end of the plastic tube with tape to prevent ingress by the adhesive.</li>								</ul>							</li>							<li>Laying the EHM mat								<ul>									<li>An EHM mat has four strips of tape running along its length.  The two outside strips are double sided and these should be used to fix the mat to the primed sub-floor with the cable side up.</li>									<li>At this stage it is good practice to take a photograph of the floor.  This will be a useful record should you need to carry out any work on the floor (for example drilling holes).</li>									<li>The tile adhesive can then be applied in the normal way taking care to ensure that the heating cable is completely covered and surrounded by the adhesive.  Before applying the tiles and before the adhesive dries, carry out the second electrical check (see below).</li>									<li>It is essential to avoid mechanical damage to the heating cable.  If it is impossible to avoid walking on the cable, use soft-shoes and/or crawling boards.</li>									<li>When you have finished laying the mat, you simply stop.  There is no requirement to return the end of the cable to the connection point.The hot/cold junction must be in the floor itself and not in free air.It is most important that the cables are not allowed to touch or cross. </li>								</ul>							</li>							<li class="split"> Second electrical check								<ul>									<li>Once the mat has been laid onto the sub-floor and before the adhesive dries, the following checks should be performed.  All results should be recorded on the Installation Record Form</li>									<li>Ensure that the resistance reading (ohms) is as recorded after the first electrical check</li>									<li>Measure the insulation resistance between either end of the cold lead conductor and the earth braid using a 500V dc Insulation Resistance Meter (Megger), ensure that the insulation resistance is still in excess of 20 meg-ohms.</li>								</ul>							</li>							<li>Apply the tiles</li>							<li> Third electrical check								<ul>									<li>Once the tiles have been applied, the following checks should be performed.  All results should be recorded on the Installation Record Form.</li>									<li>Ensure that the resistance reading (ohms) is as recorded after the first electrical check</li>									<li>Measure the insulation resistance between either end of the cold lead conductor and the earth braid using a 500V dc Insulation Resistance Meter (Megger), ensure that the insulation resistance is still in excess of 20 meg-ohms</li>																					</ul>							<li>Electrical connection								<ul>									<li><!--The electrical connection instructions supplied with the controller should be followed. It is essential that the total load controlled by a single controller does not exceed 15A. (If using the A16c the total load must not exceed 16A)-->Follow the electrical connection instructions supplied with the controller.</li>								</ul>							</li>							<li>Energising								<ul>									<li>The system should not be energised within 28 days of the floor surface being laid.  To do so may damage the heating cable.</li>								</ul>							</li>							<li>Warranty								<ul>									<li>This product is designed to give many years of satisfactory service. In the unlikely event of a malfunction the product is guaranteed for a period of 10 years from the date of purchase. This guarantee is validated by the Installation Record form which is supplied with every underfloor heating product being fully completed by the qualified installing contractor at the time of installation and returned to BN Thermic Ltd within 60 days of installation.
