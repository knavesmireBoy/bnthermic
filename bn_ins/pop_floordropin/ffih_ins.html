Do not install air outlet closer than         I50mm from any wall or window. Do not cover the heater as this can cause         overheating and may damage the unit and become a fire hazard. It must         not be installed in the immediate surroundings of a bath, shower or swimming         pool.</p>						<p><strong>FIXING</strong><br>							Unpack the heater and remove all packing materials. Disassemble the heater.         Cut an opening in the floor, 365 x 188, a minimum depth of 200mm is required.         If a concrete floor is used set the recess box so that the flange will         rest flush with the finished floor. Remove a convenient knock out, bush         the hole if cable is used or prepare for a conduit entry if applicable,         secure recess box in place after completing the wiring and leaving approximately         200mm of wire for termination. Install the heater in the box and remove         the terminal cover - 2 screws. Connect the supply cable earth wire to         the green earth terminal. The live wire usually red or brown to the wire         marked LI. The neutral, usually black or blue to the wire marked N. After         ensuring all electrical connections are tight, refit the terminal cover.         This unit must be earthed. Make sure no foreign material is present and         the fan is free to turn. Fit the protective grill. Finally fit the main         grill using the 2 screws provided. Apply power to the heater to test.         Sometimes a slight odour may be noticed, this is the protective coating         of the element, it will disappear after a few moments of operation. </p>						<p><strong>OPERATION </strong><br>							The heater is designed to be controlled by a manual switch or a room thermostat	        and the fan and heater element are designed to run together. It is fitted         with two safety devices. Should an overheat situation occur the automatic         device will operate. This leaves the fan running but turns off the element.         If the cause, usually a temporary air obstruction, is removed the heater         will reset itself and continue to operate. Should the cause remain a second         reset will operate and turn the unit off. This device is to be manually         reset and a qualified electrician should be consulted. <strong>Warning non         user serviceable.</strong></p>						<p></p>						<h5>GENERAL MAINTENANCE ON ELECTRIC HEATERS</h5>						<p>BN Thermic Electric Heaters are factory assembled and tested and are         non user serviceable.</p>						<p>They are designed to operate for many years, problem free.</p>						<p>All moving parts are factory lubricated and should require no service.</p>						<p>Maintenance is limited to the keeping of both inlet and exhaust areas         free from any accumulation of dust and other foreign materials. This is         especially important immediately before a heating season. Any dust build-up         can be loosened with a brush and a vacuum cleaner applied to the airways         to ensure complete removal of dust materials. An unusual odour may be         noted on the initial turn-on period as any dust particles may have been         disturbed and will be burnt off from the element.</p>						<p>If you are in any doubt contact your electrician for advice.</p>						<p><strong>Warranty.</strong> Your BN Thermic product is guaranteed for one year         from date of purchase. We will repair or replace at our discretion any         part found to be defective.
